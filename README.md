# Hi there, I'm Sandra Obunga üëã

### Full-Stack Engineer | Digital Product Architect

I build complete, end-to-end digital solutions, from the database to the final pixel. My strength lies in combining the backend robustness of a software engineer with the frontend finesse of a UI/UX architect.

My experience is rooted in a deep understanding of both backend systems engineering and user-centric frontend development. This dual-focus gives me a unique perspective, allowing me to build applications that are robust and scalable without sacrificing an elegant user experience.

## üîπ My Engineering Philosophy

*   **Full-Picture Problem Solving:** I believe the best solutions are born from understanding the entire technology stack. My approach starts with architecting a solid backend and API design that can seamlessly power a dynamic and responsive user interface.

*   **Performance is a Feature:** A beautiful UI is only as good as the engine running it. I prioritize efficient data structures, optimized queries, and clean backend logic to ensure a fast and reliable user experience.

*   **The Artistic Edge:** With a background in the arts, I bring a level of design sensibility that ensures the final product is not just technically sound, but a genuine pleasure to interact with. This is my secret weapon.
