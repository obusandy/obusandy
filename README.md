# 💫 Hi There, I'm Sandra:
<br>🚀 I'm currently looking forward to collaborate on React projects and contribute to exciting open-source initiatives.<br><br>💡 Fun Fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me experimenting with different art mediums, from watercolors to digital illustrations. I believe that creativity fuels innovation, and art is my favorite way to express that creativity!<br><br>🌟 Let's connect and build something amazing together! Feel free to reach out to me.<br>
